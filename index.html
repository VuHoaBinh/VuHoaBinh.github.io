						<p>Hello!! My name is Vu Hoa Binh. My nickname is Tom. I'm 19 years old. I'm a sophomore at the uni in VietNam. I was born and raised in DaNang city, a beautiful coastal city. <strong> This is my website. (13/11/22) </strong>

						<p>A celebrity that I’d be honored to meet is Taylor Swift. Swift is an acclaimed musician who has acquired a global reputation for numerous hits over the past 20 years. She is also widely known for her exceptional song-writing ability.</p>

						<p>I started listening to Taylor Swift’s music since middle school. I’ve been a huge fan of hers ever since. I find her tunes incredibly catchy and have always admired her lyrical skills. Also, through watching numerous interviews and talk shows featuring Taylor, I’ve come to adore her calm and collected personality, which is why I’d love to be able to interact with her in person.</p>

						<p>Furthermore, Taylor Swift has long been my role model for many reasons. She’s not only a talented musician but also an independent and headstrong woman, who works hard to achieve her goals and fight for what she believes in. She never lets backlash and criticism get in the way of her success. It would be wonderful if I could simply chat with her over coffee about how she has overcome drawbacks in her career. I could learn a lot from that.</p>

						<p>Badminton is one of my favorite sport. There are some reasons why I am interested it. First, my health can be improved by playing it. It makes me feel energetic everyday. Furthermore, I enjoy the feeling of the badminton flying in the air. During the game, I can change the direction of badminton with little effort and beat my opponents. Besides that, I can make many friends when I play badminton. I often play it with various types of people. We can improve our skills through discussion and practice. Also, we can talk about many interesting things when we have a break. Finally, playing badminton is not as intense as other sports such as basketball or soccer. It lessens the possibility of being hurt. To sum up, playing badminton benefits a person not only physically but mentally as well. I usually play at least once or twice a week.</p>
